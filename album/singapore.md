In August 2019, I was fortunate enough to be selected for a cultural exchange program in Singapore. It was a remarkable and unforgettable experience. During the stay in Singapore, I visited various renowned landmarks such as the Merlion Park and the National Orchid Garden. I also had the privilege of engaging in exchange activities at both the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) and [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/).
