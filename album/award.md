In March 2019, I successfully passed the preliminary selection and had the opportunity to participate in the final of the 10th Chinese Mathematics Competitions for College Students held at [Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)](http://en.hit.edu.cn/). It fills me with great pride to share that I won the first prize in the competition. This is my first national award, which I am deeply impressed with.
