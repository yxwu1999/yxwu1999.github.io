During my undergraduate years, I had the wonderful opportunity to participate in two significant events: the Welcome Party and the Graduation Ceremony. 

At the Welcome Party, I was involved in a captivating theatrical performance, where I had the chance to embody the character of a skilled swordsman.

For the Graduation Ceremony, I took part in an energetic dance performance, performing to the music of ["Famed Star in Unsettled World"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maDcak9bJH4) by [Jordan Chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chan).
