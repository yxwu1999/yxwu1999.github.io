Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the core of uncertainty analysis, which tries to quantify the outcomes when inputs are subject to uncertainties. This problem is vital in modern power systems for their inherent randomness in nature.

In my research of uncertainty in power systems, I mainly focus on efficient high-dimensional UQ, as well as UQ-informed decision-making, i.e., stochastic opf. We have designed two different approaches to handle stochastic opf. The first one conducts data-driven surrogate modeling under arbitrarily distributed and correlated uncertainties using a recent variant of polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), which is more accurate than traditional PCE methods, as revea . In this work, we also embedded voltage stability constraint into the problem and developed a novel framework to improve the scalability  in large-scale systems.

The second work is still in preparation, which relies on a novel deterministic sampling method that requires much fewer computational efforts than the Monte Carlo method. This appealing property makes it quite suitable to be combined with the distributionally robust method to deal with chance constraints.
